How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  
  I write code to have a as few lines as possible while still maintaining full functionality. This keeps it from becoming confusing, messy or
  Illegible to someone looking at it for the first time. I go through the code one piece at a time, making sure that I achieve the desired result on the current
  section of code I am creating so that I can move onto the next. This allows me to be orderly and know that I am making progress as I go through.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  My approach to this project was the same as the previous ones I have had. Take each portion of the assignment piecemeal, going down the line in objectives rather 
  than becoming overwhelmed by the full scope of the project. The difference between this assignment and others was having to deal with a mongo database. This created
  an added difficulty by not being as easily usable as SQL and additionally, going through a virtual machine to use notebook was an additonal difficutly as it would not
  read my png or py files unless I gave explicit directions to where it was located.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer scientists maintain networks and databases, among other things, and allow developers like us or users to easily go through a system to find what they
  need more effectively. For this project specifically, it allows for a user to search for their specific breed of dog and find their location with the click of a button,
  saving a great deal of time.
